# CNN
I developed some CNN models with various experiment showing benefits of following techniques:

1) Increasing number of filters in convolution layers.
2) Increasing number of convolution layers.
3) Taking advantages of Dropout layers.
4) Taking advantages of Data augmentation.
5) Taking advantages of Batch norm layers.
